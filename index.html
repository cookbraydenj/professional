                Priorities are what are most important to us.
              My conclusion is that our focus changes our perspective, which shifts our priorities. As we focus on Jesus Christ and His gospel, He adjusts our perspective to see Him more clearly in our lives, which leads us to revise our priorities as we align our will with God’s."

                <p class="description">
                  I am thrilled and honored to share my insights with you today. I am humbled to share the same stage as professors, scholars, and general authorities. Attending the weekly devotionals has been the highlight of my time here at BYU. It is my deepest desire to facilitate an environment for the Spirit to “enlighten your mind[s], and fill your soul[s] with joy.”  (D&C 11:13)
                  
                  In the Book of Mormon, Alma the Younger asks the members of the Church, “Have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?” (Alma 5:14) My intention is to focus our time today analyzing how we receive Christ’s image in our countenances. My conclusion is that we do so by increasing our amount of spiritual light.
                  Christ proclaims that He is the light–and that we receive light from Him. In Doctrine and Covenants Section 93, He teaches, “I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.” (D&C 93:2) We learn to what extent we can receive light in Doctrine & Covenants Section 88. Jesus declares, “If your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.” (D&C 88:67)

President James E. Faust once explained that the light we receive from Christ “shows in our countenances as well as in our eyes.” (James E. Faust, Oct 2005) The Prophet Joseph Smith recorded that the angel Moroni’s countenance was “truly like lightning.” (Joseph Smith History 1:32) He also noted that God the Father and His Son radiated a brightness that exceeded the glory of the sun. (Joseph Smiths’ First Vision Account, 1832–Joseph Smith Papers)

It is evident that the countenance of Christ is light.

	The brother of Jared learned about the light that emanates from Christ when he asked the Lord to light the barges that the Jaredites would use to cross the sea. Ether Chapter 3 explains the following:

1 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared…went forth unto the mount…and did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent glass; and he did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount, and cried again unto the Lord, saying:
 
2 O Lord, thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by the floods. Now behold…O Lord, thou hast given us a commandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we may receive according to our desires.
 
3 Behold, O Lord…suffer not that they shall go forth across this raging deep in darkness; but behold these things which I have molten out of the rock.
 
4 And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light while we shall cross the sea.
 
5 Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this. We know that thou art able to show forth great power, which looks small unto the understanding of men.
 
6 And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said these words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand and touched the stones one by one with his finger. And the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord…
 
	These sixteen small, glass-like stones were literally illuminated by the light of Christ that flows from His countenance.
 
What is light?
So, what is light? 
	
	Richard D. Draper, a former BYU religion professor of ancient scripture, wisely expounded on the meaning of light in his 2009 BYU devotional, Light, Truth, and Grace: Three Interrelated Principles Necessary for Salvation. As he explained, “...The term light is used to describe an aspect of God’s power that radiates out from Him, expanding with His work and will, enlightening, organizing, capacitating, and quickening as it does. Perhaps the best definition would be living and capacitating energy. This idea is expressed in the scripture that states, “That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day” (D&C 50:24). This scripture suggests that the continual reception of this living energy endows one with ability—one ability of which is to draw ever closer to perfection.”

What an incredible promise! As we receive light from Jesus Christ, we draw closer to perfection–closer to becoming like God. 

We have now come full circle:

 Jesus Christ is the light; He shares His light with us as we align our will with His; the light He gives us shines in our countenances; and this light enables us to become more like Him.	

How do we receive light?
What must we do to receive light?

First, may I suggest that we direct our attention to the light. Our focus must be on Jesus Christ in order to receive His light. I would like to provide a powerful illustration of how we come to see Jesus Christ more in our lives, with what is referred to as the Red Car Effect.

Known as the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon or the frequency illusion, the Red Car Effect, “is a perception that something you’ve been thinking about, or recently learned, all of a sudden seems much more frequent in your environment than it was before.” 
Before you buy a red car, you may not think that red is a popular car color. Yet after you make the purchase, thinking that your car will be unique, red cars appear everywhere.
According to Macquarie University, 
There are two parts to this phenomenon. One part is the perception of increased frequency; the second part is a confirmation bias where you believe that it didn’t happen before at the same frequency. But in reality, the frequency hasn’t changed, you just weren’t noticing it because your attention wasn’t being drawn to it.
In Doctrine and Covenants 6:36, Jesus says, “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.” No wonder he commands us to look unto Him! As we focus on Jesus Christ, our vision will be enhanced and we will see His influence more in our lives. We will realize that He is always by our side. And His light will shine down upon us–and shine through us.
If you’re a nerd, like me, then you recognize that this scripture contains the use of a semicolon–and then you examine its grammatical meaning.
From Butte College:
Often two independent clauses which are closely related in meaning can be connected by a comma and a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, not, for, so, yet). However, if the relationship between the clauses is clear without the conjunction, the writer can choose to omit the coordinating conjunction and use a semicolon instead. The semicolon tends to emphasize the close connection between the two thoughts.
Jesus could have said, “Look unto me in every thought so you have no reason to doubt nor fear.” He is saying that He is the reason why we need not doubt, and we need not fear. Jesus is “the light which shineth in darkness.” (D&C 6:21) Accordingly, our focus on Christ will endow us with light which will drive darkness from us. 
Light shines through our example	
Jesus instructs us in Matthew 5:14, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” As President Thomas S. Monson sought to understand how we let our light shine, his answer appeared in 1 Timothy 4:12. It states, “Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.” (October 4, 2015 General Conference) He believed that the second scripture clarified the first.
With this improved understanding, President Monson explained that we will receive light as we let our light shine before men. He taught, “As we follow the example of the Savior and live as He lived and as He taught, that light will burn within us and will light the way for others.” 

By exemplifying Christlike attributes in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, and in purity, we receive light from our Savior to share with others. This light radiates in our countenances.

Allow me to demonstrate this concept with a few examples.

First: In Word and Conversation
King Benjamin taught a marvelous discourse, explaining the significance of the atonement of Jesus Christ and encouraging his people to change their behavior to align themselves with Christ. Upon the completion of his sermon, the people experienced a mighty change in their hearts (Alma 5:14) and committed themselves to Christlike living. Mosiah Chapter 5 explains the events that transpired.
 
1 And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had thus spoken to his people, he sent among them, desiring to know of his people if they believed the words which he had spoken unto them.
 
2 And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.
 
3 And we, ourselves, also, through the infinite goodness of God, and the manifestations of his Spirit, have great views of that which is to come; and were it expedient, we could prophesy of all things.
 
4 And it is the faith which we have had on the things which our king has spoken unto us that has brought us to this great knowledge, whereby we do rejoice with such exceedingly great joy.
 
5 And we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do his will, and to be obedient to his commandments in all things that he shall command us, all the remainder of our days, that we may not bring upon ourselves a never-ending torment, as has been spoken by the angel, that we may not drink out of the cup of the wrath of God.
 
6 And now, these are the words which king Benjamin desired of them; and therefore he said unto them: Ye have spoken the words that I desired; and the covenant which ye have made is a righteous covenant.
 
7 And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.
 
	Through word and conversation, light flowed from a prophet of God to these faithful saints, which filled them with great joy.
 
Second: In Charity
	President Hinckley related the following story in his October 1981 General Conference talk.
 
I should like to tell you of three eighteen-year-old boys. In 1856 more than a thousand of our people, some of them perhaps your forebears, found themselves in serious trouble while crossing the plains to this valley. Because of a series of unfortunate circumstances, they were late in getting started. They ran into snow and bitter cold in the highlands of Wyoming. Their situation was desperate, with deaths occurring every day.
 
President Young learned of their condition as the October general conference was about to begin. He immediately called for teams, wagons, drivers, and supplies to leave to rescue the bereft Saints. When the first rescue team reached the Martin Company, there were too few wagons to carry the suffering people. The rescuers had to insist that the carts keep moving.
When they reached the Sweetwater River on November 3, chunks of ice were floating in the freezing water. After all these people had been through, and in their weakened condition, that river seemed impossible to cross. It looked like stepping into death itself to move into the freezing stream. Men who once had been strong sat on the frozen ground and wept, as did the women and children. Many simply could not face that ordeal.
And now I quote from the record: “Three eighteen-year-old boys belonging to the relief party came to the rescue, and to the astonishment of all who saw, carried nearly every member of the ill-fated handcart company across the snowbound stream. The strain was so terrible, and the exposure so great, that in later years all the boys died from the effects of it. When President Brigham Young heard of this heroic act, he wept like a child, and later declared publicly, ‘that act alone will ensure C. Allen Huntington, George W. Grant, and David P. Kimball an everlasting salvation in the Celestial Kingdom of God, worlds without end.’” (Solomon F. Kimball, Improvement Era, Feb. 1914, p. 288.)
	Through this heroic act, these boys received light from Christ and illuminated the way for others on the trail to Utah.
Third: In Spirit
At the conclusion of my mission, in Cordoba, Argentina, I wrote a letter to my mission president, detailing what I had learned throughout the course of my mission and how my missionary service had positively impacted my life. I humbly share one part of that letter.

“I am content with my personal effort and my dedication throughout my mission. I gave my all and I have been greatly blessed because of it. I believe the Lord has accepted my offerings and has taught me and guided me along the way. I have been greatly influenced for good and I was able to see my influence for good on members, investigators, companions, and on the mission culture.

“I will forever remember these words that were impressed upon my mind as I was on the bus, leaving Rio Cuarto (my penultimate area) for Las Flores (my final area) and wondering if I had completed what the Lord had asked me to do and if He had accepted my efforts. From Matthew 25:21, I heard, ‘Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.’

“At that moment, I knew the Lord had witnessed my devotion to Him and my honest and good intentions and that He was proud of the sacrifices I had made to serve His children. He had accepted my offerings to Him. And that assurance, more than anything, makes my mission worth the difficulties and the trials. I am satisfied knowing that I gave my very best. And I have been greatly blessed because of my mission service.”

Through my diligence and sacrifice, the Lord blessed me with additional light. He not only changed the course of my life, but He changed me.
 
Fourth: In Faith 
Saints, Volume 3 tells of the miraculous healing of a young Dutch boy named Jan Roothoff. A prophet of God, full of light, quite literally restored this child’s ability to receive and perceive light.
 
That summer (in 1906), European Saints learned that President Joseph F. Smith was taking a brief tour of their continent. The news thrilled eleven-year-old Jan Roothoff, especially when he heard that the prophet’s first appearance would be in the Netherlands, where Jan lived. The boy was too excited to talk about anything else.
	
Several years earlier, Jan had caught a disease that infected his eyes and made him sensitive to light. His mother, Hendriksje, a single parent, kept him out of school and tried to make him as comfortable as possible by hanging curtains so he could play in the dark. But he eventually went blind, and doctors told his mother that he would never regain his sight.
Jan now wore bandages over his eyes to protect them from the light. But he knew that if anyone could heal his eyes, it was a prophet of God. “Mother, he is the most powerful missionary,” he said. “All he has to do is look into my eyes and I will be well.”
Jan’s mother believed that the Lord could heal him, but she was reluctant to encourage him to seek President Smith’s help. “The president is very busy just now,” she replied. “There are hundreds of people who want to see him. You are only a boy, my son, and we must not intrude.”
On August 9, 1906, Jan and his mother attended a special meeting in Rotterdam, where President Smith spoke to about four hundred Saints. As Jan listened to him speak, he tried hard to picture the prophet. Before losing his eyesight, Jan had seen a photograph of President Smith, and he remembered his kind face. Now he could hear kindness in the prophet’s voice as well, even though he had to wait for a missionary to translate the words into Dutch before he understood them.
President Smith spoke about the power of missionaries. “It is their business to come to you and to show you the greater light,” he said, “that your eyes may be opened, that your ears may be unstopped, that your hearts may be touched with a love for the truth.”
Jan’s faith did not waver. After the meeting, his mother led him to a doorway where President Smith and his wife Edna were greeting the Saints. “This is the president, little Jan,” Hendriksje said. “He wants to shake hands with you.”
Taking him by the hand, President Smith lifted away Jan’s bandages. He then touched the boy’s head and peered into his inflamed eyes. “The Lord bless you, my boy,” he said. “He will grant you the desires of your heart.”
Jan did not understand President Smith’s English, but his eyes had already begun to feel better. When he arrived home, he could not suppress his joy. He tore off his bandages and looked toward the light. “See, Mother,” he said. “They are healed. I can see well!”
His mother hurried to him and tested his vision in every way she could imagine. Jan could indeed see just as well as he could before the disease.
This young boy’s childlike faith enabled him to receive physical and spiritual light.
Finally: In Purity
Immediately after the first Saints arrived in the Salt Lake valley, they started construction on a temple. The Salt Lake Temple would take more than 40 years to complete. Saints throughout the state had dedicated their time, money, means, and labor to the creation of the temple and were overjoyed to see its completion. Church leaders held two dedication sessions a day for more than two weeks so that tens of thousands of saints could attend the dedication of the temple. The following events are recorded from dedicatory sessions of the Salt Lake Temple.
 
1. “Susa Young Gates, the official stenographer for the dedicatory services, attended the first session of the dedication. “I was sitting on the lower side of the east pulpits, at the recorder’s table,” she wrote. “Almost as soon as President [Joseph F.] Smith began to address the Saints, there shone through his countenance a radiant light that gave me a peculiar feeling. I thought that the clouds must have lifted, and that a stream of sunlight had lighted on the President’s head. … I looked out of the window, and somewhat to my surprise … there was not the slightest rift in the heavy, black clouds above the city; there was not a gleam of sunshine anywhere. … Whence had come the light that shone from the face of President Smith? I was sure that I had seen the actual Presence of the Holy Spirit, focussed upon the features of the beloved leader. … I cherish the occurrence as one of the most sacred experiences of my life.10 
 
2. “Sister Gates was not the only person to witness the light surrounding President Smith. An elder seated at the opposite end of the room saw a light of “yellowish or golden tint and exceedingly brilliant” appear around President Smith as he spoke.”
 
3. “…On Monday, 17 April 1893, Brother Andrew Smith, Jr., a member of the Tabernacle Choir, opened his eyes as President Cannon read the dedicatory prayer. He said of the experience, “I saw a bright light appeared above [President Cannon’s] head and behind him from his shoulders upwards. This light remained in that position a few moments and then raised until I could see the face of a personage in the midst of it. It was the countenance of President Brigham Young. I turned my gaze away for a moment … and then I beheld the person of President John Taylor. … I also saw a personage whom I took to be Hyrum Smith … then Orson Pratt, whom I at once recognized. … When the prayer was concluded and just before and during the sacred hosanna shout, I noticed a bright halo of light surrounding several of the brethren. … I was overcome and wept for joy. Having my head bowed for a short time I saw nothing more for a few moments. On raising it again I saw a brilliant light over the head of each member of the First Presidency while they sat upon the stand. Whichever way any of the speakers turned while addressing the people, the light followed every movement made by them.”
 
4. “…Outside the temple, others saw a “glow of glorious light surround the Temple and circle about it as if it were an intelligible Presence.”
 
The pure intentions and desires of this Christlike group of saints bestowed them with heavenly light.

How do we fulfill our responsibility to let our light shine?
Jesus delegates to us a sacred responsibility in 3 Nephi Chapter 12 when He says, “I give unto you to be the light of this people.” It is my understanding that we are to light the world by sharing our light with the world, which comes from the light of the world–Jesus Christ. How do we fulfill this obligation? 

	President Kevin Worthen beautifully answered this question with an inspiring story in his BYU devotional, The Light of the Y. 
He said, Never underestimate the power your light can have on others. Let me illustrate this with a reference to a lighthouse. All of us are familiar with lighthouses. They send out a beacon of light that can hopefully be seen in the worst weather. They mark the line where the sea ends and the land begins—a very important marker for those who are piloting boats, especially in bad weather.
But lighthouses also have another role to play for those who are piloting boats. In addition to marking the place at which the sea ends and the land begins, lighthouses can, with the help of other lights, guide sailors through treacherous waters in which reefs and other unseen barriers might sink the ship. In such situations there is often only one safe passage to the harbor, and the only way the pilot knows the ship is in that passage is by maneuvering the ship so that the light at the top of the lighthouse aligns with a carefully placed light on the shore. Once the ship is in that position, it can proceed safely as long as those lights—the one in the lighthouse and the one on the shore—are in alignment with each other. If they are out of alignment, the ship is off course, and there is considerable risk of a tragic shipwreck.	

More than a hundred years ago, a well-known Protestant preacher, Dwight L. Moody, shared a story of a ship trying to enter the Cleveland harbor on a very stormy night.
The ship’s captain could see the bright light of the Cleveland harbor lighthouse. However, the lower lights weren’t visible at all. The lower lights were the way that ships identified the centerline of the safe entry to a harbor.
Because the lower lights were not burning that night, the ship missed the entrance to the harbor and crashed into rocks. Many lives were lost.
At the end of his sermon, Moody said, “Brethren, the Master will take care of the great lighthouse; let us keep the lower lights burning.”
One of the members of Moody’s congregation that day was a man named Philip Paul Bliss, a musician. Bliss was so inspired by the lesson in Moody’s sermon that he wrote a hymn, which in our hymnbook is entitled “Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy.” Many of you will be familiar with the hymn. All of you should be. With the image of the lighthouse and this experience in mind, consider the message of the first verse of that hymn:
Brightly beams our Father’s mercy
From his lighthouse evermore,
But to us he gives the keeping
Of the lights along the shore.
Let the lower lights be burning;
Send a gleam across the wave.
Some poor fainting, struggling seaman
You may rescue, you may save.
	Our assignment from the Savior is to lead others to Him. May we all guide our brothers and sisters to Christ’s ever-shining lighthouse so that we may bask in His glorious light.
	I testify of the light that comes from Jesus Christ. He is the “light of the world.” (John 8:12) As we follow Him, we “shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” (John 8:12) Our souls will be “illuminated by the light of [His] everlasting word.” (Alma 5:7) And our countenances will shine with His image.
In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

                <h4 class="title"><a href="">Focus, Perspective, Priorities</a></h4>
                <p class="description">One of my most feared conversations growing up was when, on Sundays, my parents would ask us how Church was that day and to tell them what we had learned. I hated this tradition. I wanted my parents to realize that Church was boring and the old people in my ward only talked about family history and temple work, and that 3 hour Church was way too long. Meanwhile, during Sacrament meeting, I was either taking a nap, or playing tic tac toe with one of my nine siblings, or even playing paper football. No wonder I was bored! 

                  Well, I am now happy to share that although I was wrong about Church being boring and family history not being important, even the Prophet agreed with me that 3 hour Church was too long. 
                  
                  Now I know first hand how difficult it is to pay attention to sacrament meeting talks. So I’m going to guilt trip you today: I will be speaking about the importance of our focus. Gotcha! If you can’t focus during a talk about focus, then you might need this talk more than I thought... I am using a lot of stories to get my point across, so hopefully when you all FaceTime your parents today, you can remember something that happened at Church. 
                  
                  I was asked to speak on maintaining an eternal perspective in our lives through Jesus Christ and I gained a lot of new insights on this particular topic, so I really hope to help you see something in a new light, or with a different perspective. My goal today is to invite the presence of the Spirit to enlighten your minds, and fill your souls with joy, as D&C 11:13 tells us.
                  
                  Overview:
                  I believe that three topics shift our eternal perspective. These topics are focus, perspective, and priorities. 
                    Focus is the center of our attention.
                    Perspective is our point of view.
                    Priorities are what are most important to us.
                  My conclusion is that our focus changes our perspective, which shifts our priorities. As we focus on Jesus Christ and His gospel, He adjusts our perspective to see Him more clearly in our lives, which leads us to revise our priorities as we align our will with God’s. 
                  
                  President Dallin H. Oaks has said,
                  “The pure in heart have a distinctive way of looking at life. Their attitudes and desires cause them to view their experiences in terms of eternity. This eternal perspective affects their choices and priorities. As they draw farther from worldliness they feel closer to our Father in Heaven and more able to be guided by his Spirit.”
                  
                  Focus:
                  Joy and Spiritual Survival, by Russell M. Nelson (Focus)
                  President Nelson taught us that we are on this Earth to have joy–and that the joy we feel has everything to do with the focus of our lives. His October 2016 General Conference talk was legendary and inspiring. However, I only remembered that particular quote from that talk. As I reread this talk, I discovered the amazing story he shared that preceded his insight about our focus. He said,
                  What must we do to claim the joy that Heavenly Father has in store for us?
                  Eliza R. Snow, second General President of the Relief Society, offered a riveting answer. Because of Missouri’s infamous extermination order, issued at the onset of the grueling winter of 1838, she and other Saints were forced to flee the state that very winter. One evening, Eliza’s family spent the night in a small log cabin used by refugee Saints. Much of the chinking between the logs had been extracted and burned for firewood by those who preceded them, so there were holes between the logs large enough for a cat to crawl through. It was bitter cold, and their food was frozen solid.
                  That night some 80 people huddled inside that small cabin, only 20 feet square. Most sat or stood all night trying to keep warm. Outside, a group of men spent the night gathered around a roaring fire, with some singing hymns and others roasting frozen potatoes. Eliza recorded: “Not a complaint was heard—all were cheerful, and judging from appearances, strangers would have taken us to be pleasure excursionists rather than a band of gubernatorial exiles.”
                  Eliza’s report of that exhausting, bone-chilling evening was strikingly optimistic. She declared: “That was a very merry night. None but saints can be happy under every circumstance.”
                  That’s it! Saints can be happy under every circumstance. We can feel joy even while having a bad day, a bad week, or even a bad year!
                  My dear brothers and sisters, the joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives.
                  He then added, 
                  As our Savior becomes more and more real to us and as we plead for His joy to be given to us, our joy will increase.
                  
                  The early Saints suffered extreme persecution and turmoil, but many of them were filled with joy due to their focus on Jesus Christ.
                  
                  Perspective:
                  The Love and Laws of God, by Russell M. Nelson 
                  In one of my favorite BYU devotionals, President Nelson shares a story from his medical experience that illustrates how a simple change in his perspective led to the first-ever human open heart surgery. President Nelson also became the first surgeon to perform open-heart surgery in the state of Utah after using his innovative technology.
                  
                  He related, After graduating from medical school, I pursued advanced education in surgery. At that time there was no such thing as heart surgery. Then I teamed up with other researchers in the daunting task of making an artificial heart and lung machine. We knew that such an apparatus could possibly maintain the body’s circulation while repairs might be made on the heart. But during that early era, there was much we did not know.
                  Then one day, two truths articulated in the Doctrine and Covenants spoke to my inquiring mind. These truths were, first, that all blessings are predicated upon obedience to law and, second, that to every kingdom there is a law given.
                  Well, I reasoned that if every kingdom had a law, there must be laws that govern the beating heart. I was determined to discover those laws and obey them. By doing so, blessings would come and lives could be saved.
                  In medical school I had been taught that if one touched the beating heart, it would stop beating. However, one of the first laws we discovered in the lab was that we could touch the heart of an animal without losing its heartbeat. This finding opened the door later to uncovering another law that made more complex open-heart operations possible.
                  We learned that if we added potassium chloride to blood flowing into the coronary arteries, thereby altering the normal sodium/potassium ratio, the heart would stop beating instantly. Then, when we nourished the heart with blood that had a normal sodium/potassium ratio, the heart would spring back to its normal beating pattern. Literally we could turn the heart off long enough to repair it and then turn it back on again.
                  Decades later, when I explained this to a group of medical students, one prominent professor asked, “But what if it doesn’t work?” My answer? It always works, because it is based on divine law.
                  First of all, isn’t President Nelson amazing?! I love this story because it shows me how President Nelson solved an extremely complex problem only after he shifted his perspective from a worldly perspective to a divine perspective. Likewise, as we focus on Jesus Christ with an eternal perspective, we will receive revelation to guide us in our journey back to our Father.
                  
                  Priorities:
                  An American Son, by Marco Rubio 
                  My favorite story about the power of priorities comes from the autobiography of a current United States Senator. After he was first elected to the Senate in 2010, he was approached by an experienced Senator from the opposing party. As the young Senator recorded,
                  
                  He (the older Senator) offered me a simple admonition–straightforward but powerful advice.
                  
                  Over the years, he said, he had missed his share of family events while he was stuck in Washington casting a critical vote or working on important legislation. Everyone has a job to do, he acknowledged, and this was his. Almost all parents miss something in their children’s lives because they had work to do. Your kids will understand.
                  
                  But once, when his children were still young, the president called him personally to invite him to an important occasion. When he checked his calendar, he found it conflicted with one of his children’s events, and he called the president back and respectfully declined his offer. Years later, he couldn’t remember the event the president had invited him to, but his children had never forgotten that he had turned down the president of the United States to be with them.
                  
                  This older Senator proved to his kids by his actions that they were most important to him. He put their t-ball game, or dance recital–or whatever it was–over an intimate meeting with the most powerful political leader on the planet. What actions are we taking to show God that we prioritize Him over everything else? Do we set apart the Sabbath Day to honor Him? Do we attend the temple regularly? Do we spend time with Him daily, on our knees and in our scriptures? Do we go out of our way each day to serve His children?
                  
                  As we focus on Jesus Christ, our perspective will change, which will transform our desires into prioritizing the Lord above all other worldly things.
                  
                  Example of an Eternal Perspective
                  Abinadi, in the Book of Mormon, portrayed His complete confidence in the Lord because of His eternal perspective. He boldly shared the gospel of Christ with King Noah and his priests and was killed because of it. He identifies that his eternal perspective enabled him to withstand public humiliation, imprisonment, and death for Christ’s sake.
                  
                  Abinadi, in Mosiah 13:9, says, “But I finish my message; and then it matters not whither I go, if it so be that I am saved.”
                  If it so be that I am saved. I am grateful for Abinadi’s focus on Jesus Christ, which gave him an eternal perspective to prioritize teaching Christ’s gospel, no matter the cost.
                  
                  The Red Car Effect
                  I would like to close with a powerful illustration of how we come to see Jesus Christ more in our lives, with the Red Car Effect.
                  
                  Known as the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon or the frequency illusion, the Red Car Effect, “is a perception that something you’ve been thinking about, or recently learned, all of a sudden seems much more frequent in your environment than it was before.” 
                  Before you buy a red car, you may not think that red is a popular car color. Yet after you make the purchase, thinking that your car will be unique, red cars seem to pop up all over the place.
                  According to Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia,
                  “There are two parts to this phenomenon. One part is the perception of increased frequency; the second part is a confirmation bias where you believe that it didn’t happen before at the same frequency. But in reality, the frequency hasn’t changed, you just weren’t noticing it because your attention wasn’t being drawn to it.”
                  In D&C 6:36, Christ says, “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.” No wonder he commands us to look unto Him! As we focus on Jesus Christ, our vision will be enhanced and we will see His influence more in our lives. We will realize that He is always by our side.
                  If you’re a nerd like me, then you also recognize that this scripture uses a semicolon–and then you examine its grammatical meaning.
                  From Butte College in Oroville, California:
                  Often two independent clauses which are closely related in meaning can be connected by a comma and a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, not, for, so, yet). However, if the relationship between the clauses is clear without the conjunction, the writer can choose to omit the coordinating conjunction and use a semicolon instead. The semicolon tends to emphasize the close connection between the two thoughts.
                  Jesus could have said, “Look unto me in every thought so you have no reason to doubt nor fear.” He is saying that He is the reason why we need not doubt, and we need not fear. As we focus on Him, our perspective will be enlightened. We will adjust our priorities to align our will with His. And we will deepen our personal connection to Him.
                  Testimony
                  I have seen in my own life how a focus on the Savior leads to increased joy and selflessness. An eternal perspective shapes our vision and changes our behavior so that we more closely follow the Good Shepherd.
                  In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

                <h4 class="title"><a href="">The Need for a Church</a></h4>
                <p class="description">

                  I have chosen to speak on a topic that I feel is essential to understand as I teach the people of Argentina about Jesus Christ: the purpose of each the gospel and the church in helping us return to live with Heavenly Father. The purpose of missionaries of the church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints according to Preach My Gospel is to “Invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the holy ghost, and enduring to the end.” This statement directly refers to the gospel without mentioning the church. However, the purpose of a missionary cannot be accomplished without a church. While one can have faith in Jesus Christ without a church, baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost, along with additional saving ordinances, cannot be performed without a church with the proper priesthood authority.
                  
                  Elder Donald L. Hallstrom's talk, titled “Converted to His gospel through His church,” begins by Elder Hallstrom stating that, “I love the gospel of Jesus Christ and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Sometimes we use the terms gospel and Church interchangeably, but they are not the same. They are, however, exquisitely interconnected, and we need both.” He then proceeds to define the gospel, stating, “The gospel is the glorious plan of God in which we, as His children, are given the opportunity to receive all that the Father has. This is called eternal life and is described as “the greatest of all the gifts of God” (D&C 14:7). A vital part of the plan is our earthly experience﻿—a time to develop faith, to repent, and to reconcile ourselves with God.” The gospel enables us to return to God, and receive all that he hath. In order to help us strengthen our testimonies, however, Jesus Christ established a church, which was later restored by Joseph Smith.
                  
                  Elder Hallstrom expounds on this by saying, “The Church was established by Jesus Christ during His earthly ministry, “built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets” (Ephesians 2:20). In this, “the dispensation of the fulness of times” (D&C 128:18), the Lord restored what once was, specifically telling the Prophet Joseph Smith, “I will establish a church by your hand” (D&C 31:7). Jesus Christ was and is the head of His Church, represented on earth by prophets holding apostolic authority.”
                  
                  The church is an organization created to provide order and structure for the gospel to be lived and spread. It is through the church that men can receive the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods by proper authority for the benefit of blessing, healing, and comforting others. It is by the power of the priesthood that ordinances are performed and miracles are accomplished. 
                  
                  Tithing is a fundamental program within the church. Not only does giving 10% of one's increase bless the giver's life immeasurably, but it provides necessary funds for the church to use to build the kingdom of God and to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ with others. From tithing, thousands of churches are built across the world, creating places of worship for millions of members worldwide. More than 150 temples have been built, providing adequate structures for members to  make sacred covenants, perform saving ordinances for the dead, and enable families to be sealed for eternity. The missionary program of the church provides a functional and manageable way for the gospel to be spread throughout the world by those specifically set apart as messengers of Jesus Christ to proclaim the truthfulness of the gospel. Through these church programs, millions of people are given an opportunity to hear the message of the gospel, receive saving ordinances, and strengthen their testimonies of the gospel through worshiping with fellow members. Through the church we grow in the gospel.
                  
                  
                  Every week, we attend church to partake of the sacrament, a vital function of the church. But we also teach and receive lessons of the gospel, read from the scriptures, uplift and support those in need, minister to others, hold callings, feel and heed the promptings of the Spirit, etc. Every month fast offerings are collected to be distributed throughout the ward to members in need. The church has also created numerous welfare programs, natural disasters relief programs, and more.
                  
                  During each week, young men and women gather to learn new skills, make new friends, serve people in need, etc. The relief society cares for members of each ward by providing meals, planning service projects, visiting people in the community, and more. The elders quorum identifies the needs of others, fills their needs, organizes service projects, and performs additional functions. The common theme from programs within the church is service. The new ministering program provides opportunities for members to love and serve others as well. Programs within the church are designed to ease the burdens of others as Christ did. Because of the programs of the church, millions are impacted for good. However, the gospel is what brings eternal salvation, with the church helping people feel the Spirit, receive saving ordinances, and come closer to Jesus Christ.
                  
                  Bishop Gerald Causse, in his talk titled “It is all about people” states, “My dear brothers and sisters, are we active in the gospel, or are we merely busy in the Church? The key is to follow the example of the Savior in all things. If we do that, we will naturally focus on saving individuals rather than performing tasks and implementing programs.” 
                  
                  In his same talk, Bishop Causse quotes president Ballard, saying, “president Ballard taught, “What is most important in our Church responsibilities is not the statistics that are reported or the meetings that are held but whether or not individual people﻿—ministered to one at a time just as the Savior did﻿—have been lifted and encouraged and ultimately changed.””
                  
                  President Ballard and Bishop Causse teach us that the purpose of the church is for us to help ourselves and others come closer to Jesus Christ and our Father in Heaven by growing in the gospel rather than to check off boxes by attending meetings or fulfilling assignments.
                  
                  Particularly in this past week with all the fires and the evacuations, I have seen the purpose of the church on full display. Prayers and fasts have been organized to bless the firefighters to be safe and strengthened, the homes to be protected, and the elements to be calmed for the benefit of fighting the fires. Wards and stakes have looked out for the community, with many people providing food and donations of all kinds. The church truly exists to bless the lives of its members, as well as others in need. But the gospel exists to bring us back to Heavenly Father. Each plays its role in helping us in this mortal life, with distinctly different functions.
                  
                  In conclusion, we are all able to inherit all the Father hath and return to live with him because of the gospel of Jesus Christ. But the restored church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints has been established in order to help us learn, make covenants, serve others, and, in essence, live the gospel more fully so that we may return to Heavenly Father's presence once more. On my mission I hope to baptize the people of Argentina into the church, but, more importantly, I hope to convert them to the true gospel of Jesus Christ. May we all strive to strengthen our testimonies of the gospel by learning and serving in the church. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
